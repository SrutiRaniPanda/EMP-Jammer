# EMP-Jammer

An Emp Jammer, short for Electromagnetic Pulse Jammer, is a device designed to emit strong electromagnetic waves that can interfere with and disrupt electronic equipment. 
Emp Jammers work on the principle of creating a powerful electromagnetic pulse.
The primary goal of an Emp Jammer is to overpower the targeted deviceâ€™s circuitry, rendering it inoperable or, in some cases, permanently damaging it.
These devices were initially developed for military use to neutralize enemy electronics, but their availability on the black market has raised significant concerns.

**How Does an Emp Jammer Work?**

Emp Jammers work on the principle of creating a powerful electromagnetic pulse. 
The device typically consists of a capacitor bank, a charging circuit, and an antenna. 
When the capacitor bank discharges rapidly through the antenna, it generates a burst of electromagnetic energy that can affect electronic devices within its range. 
The targeted electronics experience a sudden surge of voltage, causing their circuits to overload and malfunction.
